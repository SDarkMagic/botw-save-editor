Description: # BotW Save Data Converter
         Python scripts for converting botw '.sav' files to '.json' files that can be editted.
         Main part of the code was written by Leoetlino(https://github.com/leoetlino/botw-tools/blob/master/save.py) I just wrote the two scripts accessible from the command line for bulk conversion.
